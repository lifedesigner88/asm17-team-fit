# AGENTS.md

## Purpose

Build SoMa Community step by step — not just fast, but in a way that makes structure and intent understandable.

## Default Start-of-Task Checklist

1. Read `README.md` — check current state and priorities
2. Explore relevant directories/code
3. Design → implement → verify
4. Write changelog automatically (see Documentation Rules)
5. Share results and next steps

## Parallel Worktree Setup

| Workspace | Path                                 | Branch              | Frontend | Backend | Scope               |
| --------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------- | -------- | ------- | ------------------- |
| main      | `/home/sejong/260309_persona-mirror` | `main`              | 3000     | 8000    | merge only          |
| work1     | `/home/sejong/persona-mirror-work1`  | `feat/email-signup` | 3001     | 8001    | Backend Steps 1→2→3 |
| work2     | `/home/sejong/persona-mirror-work2`  | `feat/frontend-mvp` | 3002     | 8002    | Frontend Steps 4→6  |

### Port Policy

- Each workspace runs on dedicated ports to avoid conflicts when running simultaneously.
- Frontend port is set via `vite.config.ts` `server.port` or `VITE_PORT` env var.
- Backend port is set via uvicorn `--port` arg or `BACKEND_PORT` env var.
- `VITE_API_BASE_URL` and `BACKEND_CORS_ORIGINS` must match the workspace's port pair.

### Worktree Rules

- `main` is updated **only via PR** — never commit or push directly to `main`.
- work1 and work2 push to their own branches and open a PR to `main`.
- PR must be reviewed and approved before merging.
- When adding a new worktree: `git worktree add <path> <branch>` from the main repo.
- When done: PR merged → `git worktree remove <path>` → delete remote branch.

## Source of Truth

- `README.md` is the authority on current state, priorities, and runtime policy.
- On conflict between docs and code, align with `README.md`.
- On major structural change, update `README.md` alongside the code.

## Architecture Rules

### Monorepo Layout

- `apps/frontend` — community UI, verification, dashboard, admin, creator PR demo
- `apps/backend` — FastAPI API, auth, verification, dashboard, admin, persona seed/demo
- `apps/ai-worker` — legacy LangGraph worker kept for later team-building experiments
- `libs/shared-interfaces` — frontend-backend contracts
- `libs/ai-models` — model loading/inference wrappers
- `libs/ui-components` — reusable UI components
- `infrastructure/terraform` — IaC

### Frontend

- React Router `loader` / `action` pattern is the default.
- Shared UI: `apps/frontend/src/common/components` (shadcn/ui under `ui/*`, unified export via `index.ts`).
- Feature code: `apps/frontend/src/features/<domain>` → subfolders `components/`, `pages/`, `layout/`, `utils/`.
- Before adding a new component, check if shared UI already covers it.
- If a pattern repeats more than once, lift it — do not inline copy-paste.
- `index.ts` is the entry point only; no logic.

### Backend

- Common code: `apps/backend/app/common`.
- Feature code: `apps/backend/app/features/<domain>` → split into `router.py`, `service.py`, `schemas.py`, `models.py` as needed.
- `apps/backend/main.py` — uvicorn entry only. App assembly in `apps/backend/app/main.py`.
- Domain names are shared with frontend: `auth`, `verification`, `dashboard`, `admin`, `persona`.
- `capture` still exists in the codebase, but it is not the current product priority.

## Runtime and Execution Rules

- Node `24.11.0` (`.nvmrc`), Python `3.11.15` (`.python-version`) — pinned to patch.
- Package managers: `pnpm` (Node), `uv` (Python).
- Local, Dockerfile, and Docker Compose use the same patch-level versions.

### Official Commands

| Command              | Purpose                           |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `pnpm setup`         | Initial install + env generation  |
| `pnpm dev`           | Local dev server                  |
| `pnpm infra:up/down` | Infra helper commands when needed |
| `pnpm docker`        | Build and run Dockerfiles         |
| `pnpm docker:logs`   | View container logs               |
| `pnpm docker:down`   | Stop all containers               |

### Script Organization

- `package.json` script order: `setup → dev → infra → docker → quality → raw tool`.
- Prefer Node/Python scripts over bash-only for cross-platform compatibility.
- Docker and local dev must not share the same cache/venv directories.

## Environment Variable Rules

- `apps/frontend/.env` and `apps/backend/.env` are not committed — only `.env.example` files are tracked.
- `compose.env` holds Docker Compose demo defaults and is tracked.
- `pnpm setup/dev/docker` auto-generate `.env` from `.env.example` when needed.
- Do not mix env roles: local dev/docker → app `.env`; compose demo → `compose.env`.

## Security and Data Rules

- Browser tokens: `httpOnly` cookies preferred over `localStorage`.
- Auth secrets: environment variables only — no code fallback.
- Input: strip/validate before storage.
- Personal data (verification info, phone numbers, links, voice/images): handled conservatively.
- Heavy AI tasks: async, separated from web request cycle.

## Quality Rules

| Task          | Command              |
| ------------- | -------------------- |
| Backend test  | `pnpm test:backend`  |
| Frontend lint | `pnpm lint:frontend` |
| Python lint   | `uvx ruff check`     |
| Python format | `uvx ruff format`    |
| Common format | `pnpm format`        |

- pre-commit config: `.pre-commit-config.yaml`.

## Documentation Rules

- On any feature, structural, or API change: update `README.md` (if needed) and `docs/changelog/YYYY-MM-DD.md`.
- Full changelog rules: `docs/changelog/README.md`.
- API reference at runtime: FastAPI OpenAPI (`/docs`, `/openapi.json`) — no manual endpoint docs.
- Backend test plans: `apps/backend/docs/api/testing.md`.

### Automatic Changelog (no user prompt needed)

After any task that changes `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, or project structure:

1. Check if `docs/changelog/YYYY-MM-DD.md` exists; create it if not.
2. Rewrite or extend the daily file using the compact structure from `docs/changelog/README.md`:
   `Day Summary` → `Recommended Reading Order` → `3~5` major bundles with `What Changed / Why It Mattered / Files To Read` → `End-of-Day Result`.
3. Prefer durable summaries over chronological raw notes.
4. Update `docs/changelog/README.md` file list if a new date file was created.

## Safety and Git Rules

- No destructive commands (`reset --hard`, mass deletion) without explicit user instruction.
- Before the final commit, share a change summary and get user approval.
- On approval: commit to current branch and push to `origin` under the same branch name.

### Branch Policy

- Independent work → new branch from latest `origin/main`.
- Dependent work → new branch from the unmerged parent branch.
- Branch names: short and domain-focused — `feat/ai`, `feat/auth`, `study/prompt-exp`.
- Do not reuse a branch that already has an open PR; create a child branch instead.

### PR Policy

- **`main` is protected — only updated via PR, never by direct push.**
- One PR = one branch.
- work1 and work2 each open a PR to `main` when their step is complete.
- Merge the previous PR before starting the next branch whenever possible; use stacked branches if not.
- A stacked PR targets the parent branch; rebase to `main` after the parent merges.
- Never add commits to an already-merged PR branch — create a new branch and cherry-pick if needed.
- Clean up merged branches (local + remote) after PR is merged.

### Creating PRs (gh CLI)

`gh auth login` requires interactive browser flow and cannot run unattended.
Use the `GH_TOKEN` env var instead — the token is stored in the git remote URL:

```bash
# Extract token from git remote URL
git remote get-url origin
# → https://<user>:<TOKEN>@github.com/...

# Create PR without interactive login
GH_TOKEN=<TOKEN> gh pr create --title "..." --body "..." --base main --head <branch>
```

- Always use `--force-with-lease` (not `--force`) when force-pushing a rebased branch.
- After a rebase, local and remote histories diverge — force-push is required before PR creation.

## Response Style

After each task, briefly state:

- What changed
- Why
- Which file to check
- 1–2 next steps

## English Correction Rule

The user is actively learning English. Apply this on every message:

1. **Correct first** — show the natural English version of the user's sentence in italics
2. **Then execute** — proceed with the task as understood

- Keep corrections brief and non-interrupting; do not explain grammar rules unless asked
- Example: user says "plz conduct this cmd" → reply with _"Please run this command"_ then run it
